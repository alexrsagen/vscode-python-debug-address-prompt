# Python Debugging Address Prompt for Visual Studio Code
> Prompt for host/port before starting a Python debugging session

This extension is designed to prompt you for a debugging address for Python
projects where the `"host"` or `"port"` field of the debugging configuration
is left blank or not provided, instead of having to create a configuration
for every single server you have.
